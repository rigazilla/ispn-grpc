# ispn-grpc

This project currently generates a gRPC proxy for an Infinispan EmbeddedCache object. 
Java and c++ clients are provided atm, with that user can put (k1,v1) and get(k1)->v1, but the idea is to extend the gRPC API to something useful to develop cache or datagrid applications in every gRCP supported language.
